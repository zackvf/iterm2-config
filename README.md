# iterm2-config
My personal configuration settings for the macOS terminal replacement iterm2, saved here for easy access on any macbook. Assumes the latest version of Homebrew and Git are already installed.

If Homebrew needs to be added to the macOS PATH, do this before the steps below:
```
Run the following commands:
>> echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/[username]/.zprofile
>> eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

# Steps to install iterm2, oh my zsh, a zsh theme, and some zsh plugins
## iterm2 installation
```
>> brew install --cask iterm2
```
^ using '--cask' with the installation is meant for gui application installations
